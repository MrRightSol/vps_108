Prompt:

We have been working on automating the setup of a VPS using a Python script. The script accomplishes the following tasks:

Logs into the server via SSH.
Creates an SSH key if it doesn't already exist and sets it up for root login.
Installs Docker and Docker Compose, checking if they are already installed.
Creates a new user, grants them access to Docker, and adds the SSH key for the new user.
Creates a specific folder structure under the new user's home directory based on a provided JSON configuration.
The script ensures that directories and files are created without using sudo, adhering to the preference to use root privileges only when absolutely necessary. The script also captures logs into a timestamped file.

Next, we need to:

Verify and test the script to ensure all components work correctly.
Consider additional steps such as setting up a reverse proxy (like Caddy or Traefik) in Docker containers.
Discuss firewall settings and security hardening measures for the VPS.
Please provide the latest version of the Python script to continue from this point.

Need a python script will read all files in a folder (paramenter) and based on rules it will organize the set of rows that represent invoices to put them in order.
Rules are in config,json and they drive logic on what and how to do it. 
skip key will indicate the row that should be skipped (meaning not sorted) and just kept the way they are, in our example skip lines 1-2 and lines 3-5.
Other rules are use to identify where the header of the invoice is by matching the key "match" and the column range 41-46, if there's a match, then we will use key "sort" to define the order, in our case ascending meaning a-z, 0-9, and so on, as well as the key "key"' that indicates what columns should be used in the sort process.
Ask me questions to what you need to get an initial script going, or just generate it and we will adjust we needed till we get it working.
